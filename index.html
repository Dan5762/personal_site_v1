                      <p>In my spare time I have been working with friends on a non-profit campaigning for
                      carbon labelling on food packaging. To push for this goal we have two parallel
                      strategies, the first is to campaign via social media and raise awareness for the
                      position. The second strategy, which I am focused on, is to develop an app
                      which allows users to calculate the CO2kgeq of a certain recipe.  The app is now 
                      available on the app store and we are working to test and further develop the app.</p>

                      <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
                      <h4>ElectronRx</h4>
                      <p>2019 - 2021</p>
                      <p>Previously working as a data scientist at a Cambridge based biotech start-up. This
                      role entailed building a predictive algorithm to infer blood pressure from a ppg
                      (photoplethysmography) signal, taken by a smartphone camera. This involved
                      harnessing approaches proposed in recent literature to develop a sufficiently
                      accurate machine learning model and effective signal processing pipeline. The work
                      was then integrated with the wider app platform, which aims to allow any modern
                      smartphone to become a medical grade device.
                      I was also been responsible for developing and maintaining the more foundational
                      algorithms that make up FoneDx, the cloud-based service. FoneDx supports the
                      calculation of heart rate and respiratory rate from ppg signals, as well as additional
                      metrics of interest to clinicians.</p>

                      <p>2019</p>
                      <p>Over a two-month period I worked to produce an account application fraud
                      detection model. The model was trained to score applications as either fraudulent orsafe. The model had many components, including features generated from user
                      sequence analysis, computed using Markov chains, an entity resolution component
                      and more general network analysis components. The features were then passed to
                      an XGBoost classifier which achieved an AUC of over 0.9.</p>
